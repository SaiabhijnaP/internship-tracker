#  Internship Tracker for Indian Students

Welcome! This is a simple, evolving web project to help Indian students track **internship deadlines** for top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and more — based on location and application period (Summer/Winter).

>  Built to solve the "Where do I find internships?" problem — especially for students who don’t want to miss a deadline ever again!



## Features (So far...)

✅ List of internships (with role, company, location, deadline)  
✅ Clean, mobile-friendly layout  
✅ Easy to update — soon from a form!  
✅ India-specific focus



##  Built With

- HTML (for structure)
- CSS *(coming soon)* for styling
- JavaScript *(coming soon)* for dynamic updates
- Firebase *(coming soon)* to store real internship data



##  Coming Soon

-  Internship submission form (so you don’t have to update HTML manually)
-  Filters by company, location, and season (Winter/Summer)
-  Optional notification system
-  Hosting via GitHub Pages



##  Why This Project?

As a student myself (graduating in 2027), I realised how hard it is to track internships — especially for Indian students where dates are different from the US. This site aims to fix that by making everything available in one place, openly and simply.
